1. Know what’s important… and eliminate the rest. In order to do this, you must take time to identify the most important things in your life. Choose activities, tasks, projects and commitments that correlate with that list. At the start of each day, take time to identify 1-3 Most Important Tasks (MITs).
2. Visualize your perfect day. This is not a time to daydream. I want to fly across the world and stay in a five-star hotel with an infinity pool, is not an acceptable answer. Be realistic! What time would you get up in the morning? What would you do first? What would you accomplish? Who would you be with? Visualizing your ideal day and committing that vision to paper will help you “work smarter, think bigger and make more.”
3. Don’t overcommit. Now that you’ve identified what’s important, you need to learn how to say “no” to things that stand in the way of your perfect day. List and prioritize your commitments, and say no to at least one.
4. Limit tasks. In addition to your 1-3 MITs, list other tasks that you’d like to do. See if you can limit this list to 5-7 tasks per day. It is OK to say no to some of them -- you can’t do it all in a day. Limiting tasks helps you focus on what’s important.
5. Remain focused. When are you going to do your most important work? Schedule it with a block of time. Make this your most sacred appointment. During this timeframe, remember to close the internet and turn off your phone.
6. Slow down. Life will not collapse if you don’t hurry from task to task, e-mail to e-mail. You are allowed to pause, take a moment to reflect, smile and enjoy your current task.
7. Don’t multitask. Instead, focus on one task at a time. Practice mindfulness as you do the task. Be conscious of wandering thoughts and redirect them as needed. Your day will be much simpler -- and more enjoyable -- when you practice being present.
8. Batch small tasks. Set aside time to respond to e-mails, file paperwork, make minor phone calls, etc. Make sure you do this later in the day, after you’ve already completed your important tasks.
9. Free up space. We have a propensity to cram. Instead, leave a little space in between meetings, appointments, and tasks. This will allow you time to stretch, walk around, get a glass of water, or meditate. Enjoy this space!
10. Make a “stop doing” list of the tasks you plan to quit, so you can focus time and energy on your MITs.

### How to Train Your Brain to Remember Almost Anything

**Spaced repetition**

One method is spaced repetition — repeating intake of what you are trying to retain over a period of time. For example, when you read a book and really enjoy it, instead of putting it away, reread it again after a month, then again after three months, then again after six months, and then again after a year. Spaced repetition leverages the spacing effect, a memory phenomenon that describes how our brains learn better when we separate out information over time. Learning something new drives out old information if you don’t allow sufficient time for new neural connection to solidify.

**The 50/50 rule**

Dedicate 50% of your time to learning anything new and the rest of your time to sharing or explaining what you have learned to someone or your audience.
Research shows that explaining a concept to someone else is the best way to learn it yourself. The 50/50 rule is a better way to learn, process, retain, and remember information.
For example, instead of completing a book, aim to read half, and try recalling, sharing, or writing down the key ideas you have learned before proceeding. Or better still, share that new knowledge with your audience.
You could even apply the 50/50 rule to individual chapters instead of the whole book. This learning method works really well if you aim to retain most of what are learning. The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to transfer it to another person.
“The best way to learn something truly is to teach it — not just because explaining it helps you understand it, but also because retrieving it helps you remember it,” says Adam Grant.

**Topic demonstrations**

Another valuable method is to make the most of topic demonstrations to understand a topic inside out. Unlike simply reading or listening to an explanation, demonstrations show you how something works and help you visualize the concept. When learning photography, design, public speaking, negotiation, or a useful new technology, watching instructional videos that demonstrate what you’re trying to learn can improve your retention rate.

**Sleep**

Finally, use sleep as a powerful aid between learning sessions. Sleep after learning is a critical part of the memory-creation process, and sleep before learning strengthens your capacity.
Evidence shows that short naps help reinforce learned material. The authors explain, “We suggest that the mere onset of sleep may initiate active processes of consolidation which — once triggered — remain effective even if sleep is terminated shortly after.” The results show that even a period of sleep is enough to help you remember what you’ve learned. Longer naps (60-plus minutes) are also great for storing new information into our permanent memory. A good night’s sleep is even better for memory recall and clear thinking.
The more the mind is used, the more robust memory can become. Taking control of information storage will not only help you retain new bits of information but also reinforce and refine the knowledge you already have.


### Productivity
Top missteps people make when trying to work at home – and how to avoid them:
* **Muddled associations**: It can seem impossible to get into productive work mode when we’re working in a space used for family, play and relaxation. We need to redesign our cognitive associations – that is, how our brain interprets our space – and give ourselves mental cues that it’s time to work, like a dedicated work-only space or even something like certain music or a scented candle.
* **Poor hygiene**:  This isn’t about washing our hands – but about keeping our workspaces “clean” from distractions. We can boost focus by creating a physical barrier to block out visual and noise distractions, turning toward the wall or briefly closing our eyes. Stow away the smartphone – which has been shown, whether it’s on or off, to be a distraction.
* **Being a passenger**: We tend to prioritize “instant gratification” tasks, like responding to e-mail, which give our brains a quick dopamine boost. Instead, we should differentiate our to-do lists by “most important tasks” (MITs) and “least important tasks” (LITs). Prioritize the MITs, breaking them down into smaller sub-tasks so you can still get that dopamine boost to keep you motivated.
* **Constant expenditure**: We tend to work more when we work at home, a recipe for burnout. We need to understand when our high and low energy peaks are and design our days to take advantage of high energy periods. And take frequent short breaks to regain energy and motivation.
* **Excessive task switching**: From a neurological standpoint, multi-tasking doesn’t work. The time spent bouncing between tasks adds up. Dedicate time to just one task – using what the researchers call “Focus Sprints” – and keep interruptive ideas on the backburner for later.
* **Always being connected**: We need to stay checked in for true emergencies, but we don’t have to pay attention to every email or every notification as they come in. That can waste time and energy. Instead, embrace “asynchronous communication” – quick batch responses to email and chat.
