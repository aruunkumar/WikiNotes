## Persuasion:
Types of questions you can ask include disturbing, leading, and rhetorical questions:
* Disturbing questions focus your listeners' attention on their most pressing problems. How much unproductive time does your staff spend locating lost parcels?"
* Leading questions influence how your listeners interpret facts and what they remember. They help plant specific information in your listeners' minds."How do you like the book-sharing feature?" 
* rhetorical questions, you are really asking a question to produce an effect, not to elicit a response. Rhetorical questions help push the listener into accepting a clearly defined proposition."Will these errors go away on their own? No, they won't. It's time for us to take action. That's why I'm recommending..."
* Paraphrase. Restate the resister's points in your own words. Then say something like "Am I understanding you correctly?" This prompts your listener to respond with comments such as, "Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying." By getting the person to agree with you—even in this small way—you establish common ground, which fosters receptivity to your ideas.
* Clarify the vital issues. Identify the resister's primary concerns. You’ll establish even more understanding and agreement. And you’ll show that you're capable of sorting out the vital issues. This can further wear down resistance.

## Planning:
 
• **Schedule power hours**. Align your energy with things that require focus. Are you a morning person? A night owl? Block out two to three 90-minute blocks (“power hours”) on your calendar each week during your most productive times. You may end up scheduling over these blocks, but you have a better shot at keeping them if you’ve consciously put them on your calendar. If you work on weekends to catch up, use the same idea of power hours to set up guardrails between the personal and the professional. Go to a private room or close your door during power hours.

• **Use look-ahead rituals.** As your role gets bigger or your life gets more complex, it gets harder to work and live without more intentional planning. Looking-ahead rituals can build space into your schedule. On an annual basis, populate your calendar with future vacation blocks, key events, doctor’s appointments, etc. Get in the habit of scanning for upcoming travel, key deliverables, or especially intense periods every month or every week. For a daily scan, look ahead and pick one meeting for which a little prep work will go a long way.

• **Be explicit about white space**. When a free hour emerges, all too often we fritter it away or we’re paralyzed by all the possibilities of what we could do — and then we kick ourselves later for not using the time well. So decide in advance how you want to use free time. Create two lists of free-time activities: a “Productive White Space” list and a “Restorative White Space” list. When choosing an activity from the list, ask yourself: How much time do I have? What is realistic to accomplish? What would be most satisfying?
