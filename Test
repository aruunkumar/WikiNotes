# Terraform for AWS AppStream 2.0

This is a Terraform module to deploy AppStream 2.0 resources for the Capital Markets Cloud Modernization Program (CMCMP).

This project is a fork of the upstream repository FCS/terraform-aws-appstream-cap. Changes should be made in this repository, tested in development environments, and merged into the upstream fork for use in production.

## AppStream Resources
Amazon AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed, secure application streaming service that allows streaming of desktop applications from AWS to a web browser. AppStream 2.0 manages the AWS resources required to host and run applications, scales automatically, and provides access to users on demand. Below are some of the important components that make up the AppStream ecosystem.

### Image builder
An image builder is a virtual machine that is used to create an image. After an image builder instance is created, the application to be streamed should be installed, configured and tested on the image builder, and then use it to create an image. 

### Fleet
A fleet consists of fleet instances (also known as streaming instances) that run the application. Note that one user requires one instance.

### Stack
A stack consists of an associated fleet, user access policies, and storage configurations. A stack should be setup to start streaming applications to users.

### AWS Managed VPC
All of the AppStream related components would be deployed within an AWS Managed VPC which is transparent to the customer/FIS. The AppStream image builder and fleet instances integrate with other resources in the customer VPC via ENIs that are provisioned along with the corresponding AppStream components.

### VPC Endpoint
Streaming traffic to and from AppStream would be kept private instead of using the public internet. This would be achieved by provisioning a VPC Endpoint in the Customer VPC through which the AppStream streaming traffic would flow. 

The detailed architecture diagram depicting all of the above components can be seen on the Conflunce page [here](https://wiki.fnis.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=10450281103).

## Network Connectivity
- **Streaming connectivity** - Since all streaming traffic would flow through the VPC endpoint, the endpoint should be created in the subnet where the user traffic will commence. For the same reason, the security groups of all the AppStream resources would restrict traffic to only the CIDR range of this subnet. This subnet should be passed to this module in the `front_end_subnet_name` variable.

- **Application resource connectivity** - Connectivity between the AppStream resources and the resources in the application VPC is established through ENIs. As part of the provisioning, AppStream creates an ENI for each of the AppStream instances (Image builder & Fleet) in the application subnet. This subnet should be passed to this module in the `app_subnet_name` variable.

## Orchestration
An AppStream setup would typically involve the following steps:

1. Provision the AppStream Image builder with a base image and VPC Endpoint
2. Install the application components on the image builder
3. Create a snapshot of the image builder
4. Use the snapshot image to create the AppStream fleet
5. Provision the AppStream stack and associate with the fleet

Since application installation needs to occur before the snapshot is created, during the first run of this module, the AppStream fleet will be provisioned using a default image. Once the application image is created (Step 3 above), this module will need to be re-triggered passing the newly created image in the variable `fleet_image_name`. This would recreate the fleet instaces using the correct application image.
